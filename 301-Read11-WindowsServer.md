Windows Server is a product of Microsoft that is designed to manage many computers, files, and services. 

## Windows 10 and Windows Server Share Similar Code

Both systems use the same kernel. Due to the Graphical User Interface (GUI), They also look a bit similar. Microsoft actually recommends that Windows Server be installed and run from the command line (because it reduces the overhead to run the server). For the Nano install, there is not a GUI and it takes up a lot less space.

## Windows Server Includes Server Software

Services like DHCP, Active Directory, Group Project Object Management, etc. These Server features aren't natively available on Windows 10, but can be obtained via third-party software (like Apache web server). Windows Server also supports higher end hardware, and has a stronger security posture.
