# Network scanning with NMAP

### What is a port?

* Ports are logical (digital) ways that computers use to manage traffic.

   * Describe it with an analogy that would help a family member understand.

     * From James A. [Ten networking concepts and analogies your grandma would understand](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/ten-networking-concepts-analogies-your-grandparents-jamie-st-patrick/) 

     * Ports are like mailboxes 

What does a port scanner send to a port to check the current status?

* It could ping them (ICMP)

* It could send a SYN packet

When a port scanner sends a request to connect, what are the three possible responses? 

* Acceptance - The recipient was listening for this protocol or info, and takes it on to move it further along the OSI Model Layers. It "opens" the door.

* Blocked/Denied - The recipient was listening at port, hears something is there, and tells it (through the door) "No, we don't want any! No soliciting." without opening the door 

* Ignored/No-Response - ...

### What are TCP and UDP and what is the difference between them?

* Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)

    - Connection-based protocol

    - 3-way Handshake

        * SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK


* User Datagram Protocol (UDP)

    - Connectionless protocol

## Common Ports

* Telnet (port 23)

* SSH (port 22)

* DNS (port 53)

* SMTP (port 25, 587//)

* HTTP (port 80)

* HTTPS (port 443)

* RDP (port 3389)

* Ping (uses ICMP - is not port specific)
