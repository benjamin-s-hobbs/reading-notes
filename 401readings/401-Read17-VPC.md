# Cloud Network Security
From: [IBM Cloud Learn Hub - What is a Virtual Private Cloud?](https://www.ibm.com/topics/vpc) (accessed by Benjamin Hobbs on 7/31/2023)





## Questions for further understanding

1. What are some of the key features of the VPC model?
* Reduced risk across the data lifecycle
* Flexible growth (resources on demand- elastic)
* High-Availability
* Security- full control to implement robust security as needed

2. What are the three tiers that comprise the three-tier architecture model?
* **Web (or Presentation) Tier** - Takes requests from web servers and presents information from the other layers to end users.
* **Application Tier** - houses the business logic and is where most processing takes place
* **Database Tier** - comprised of database servers

3. Describe the differences between a VPC and a VPN to someone you know from your previous job.
* Although only one letter apart, they are VERY different. One is like your own private section of the internet (sort of like Google Drive feels, but isn't. and the other is like a private tunnel between two networks. It's better than NO privacy, AND if someone is watching either end of the tunnel, it kinda defeats the purpose.)
