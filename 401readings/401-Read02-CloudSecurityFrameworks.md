# Cloud Security Principles and Frameworks

## Cloud Security Principles

* Cloud computing generally follows different levels of needs for consumers.
* Even though vendors may address these levels differently with their products, they still follow this fairly closely.


### Separation of Duties
* In a cloud environment, there's the inherent question...Who's responsible for what? 
   * The AWS model apporaches this with a shared responsibility model.

     * Basically, the assertion here is: There is some stuff that AWS is responsible for, and there is some stuff that the consumer is responsible for.







## Questions for Understanding

1. Explain the levels of abstraction in AWS to someone without a technical background.

2. What are the control plane and data plane responsible for in container abstraction?

3. Where does AWS Lambda fall in the layers of abstraction and what makes it so special?
