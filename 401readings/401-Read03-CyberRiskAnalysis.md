# Cyber Risk Analysis
From: [Security and Risk Management](https://resources.infosecinstitute.com/certification/security-risk-management/)

## CISSP Domain 1: Security and Risk Management - What you need to know for the exam

* The primary objectives of Information Security within the organization from a risk management perspective include:
  * To have controls in place to support the mission of the organization.
  * To have all decisions be based on the risk tolerance of the organization.

## CAUTION: This is not intuitive to military training! Strategy-Tactics-Operations (in THAT order)
* Strategic - Long-term goals 

  * Planning Horizon - An approach to creating a strategy

* Tactical - Mid-term goals

* Operational - Short-term or daily goals

Security Fundamentals: Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability (CIA Triad)

1. Confidentiality: Prevent unauthorized disclosure

2. Integrity: Detect modification of information

3. Availability: Provide timely and reliable access to resources

### Risk Management Lifecycle

* Identify
  * Categorize
* Assess
  * Analysis
    * Quantatative - Objective analysis
      1. Asset Value (AV) - How much is the asset worth?
      2. Exposure Factor (EF) - What percentage of Asset Value is lost?
      3. Single Loss Expectancy (SLE) - What does it cost if happens once?

              SLE = AV x EF
      4. Annual Rate of Occurence (ARO) - How often this will happen per year?
      5. Annualized Loss Expectancy (ALE) - What it cost per year if we do nothing?

              ALE = SLE x ARO
      6. Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) is the mitigation cost: upfront + ongoing cost
      
    * Qualitative - subjective analysis
      1. Relies on judgment, best practices, intuition, and experience
      2. Methods- Brainstorming, Delphi Technique
     
* Mitigate
* Monitor, Report, & Document

## Questions for Understanding

1. Consider a bank ATM that allows users to access bank account balances. What measures can the ATM incorporate to cover the principles of the CIA triad?
    * A low-visibility screen may be employed to preserve confidentiality
    * The ATMs location outside of the back, where it can be accessed 24/7 contributes to availability
    * The use of a PIN and locking out to many wrong attempts, combined with an on-premises camera supports the integrity of the process.


2. Name three best practices that support the CIA triad.
   * Separation of Duties - Primarily supports Integrity.
   * Dual Control - Preserves Integrity and can support Confidentiality.
   * Least Privilege - Support Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.
   * Need to know - Supports Confidentiality and Availability.

3. What are the three stages of the risk management lifecycle? What is each stage’s main goal or objective?
   * Risk Assessment - Identify, categorize, classify, and evaluate assets, threats, and vulnerabilities

   * Risk Analysis - Conduct Qualitative and Quantitative analysis of risks

   * Risk Mitigation/Response - Reduce/Transfer/or Accept the risk (or combination thereof)
