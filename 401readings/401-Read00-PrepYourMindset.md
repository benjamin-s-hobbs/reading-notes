# Prep Your Mindset

## Sharpen The Saw...on purpose (***DELIBERATE* Practice**)
From [Upgrade Your Technical Skills with Deliberate Practice.](https://web.archive.org/web/20160616225417/http://www.happybearsoftware.com/upgrade-your-technical-skills-with-deliberate-practice) (accessed by Benjamin Hobbs on 7/8/2023)

This brief article makes the assertion that simple repetition of a task does not necessarily increase skill at that task.

In order to get ***better*** at something, one must apply *deliberate practice.*

The term deliberate practice was coined by psychology professor Anders Ericsson to capture a description of the "right type of work" necessary to build what he called ["a remarkable life"]() 

To quote Cal Newport from his [blog](https://calnewport.com/flow-is-the-opiate-of-the-medicore-advice-on-getting-better-from-an-accomplished-piano-player/) 

   > The mistake most weak pianists make is playing, not practicing. If you walk into a music hall at a local university, you’ll hear people ‘playing’ by running through their pieces. This is a huge mistake. Strong pianists drill the most difficult parts of their music, rarely, if ever playing through their pieces in entirety. 

The article's author then defines deliberate practice as thus:

   > Activities designed, typically by a teacher, for the sole purpose of effectively improving specific aspects of an individual’s performance.

The key ideas behind deliberate practice are that deliberate practice should:

* **Be designed to improve performance** - deliberate practice should push one *outside* of their comfort zone, stretching an individual just beyond their current abilities.
* **Be repeated often** - high repetition is the most important difference between deliberate practice and performing the task for real. 
* **Have continuously available feedback on results** - 

* **Be highly mentally demanding** - 

* **Be difficult** - 

* **Require good goals** -

- a set of exercises that meet these criteria for the majority of intermediate to senior level developers. They relentlessly pummel you with problems that require hard, focused thinking and fiddly solutions. The feedback is continual: your solutions either break crypto and produce the desired results or they don't.

## The Power of "Yet"
From Carol Dweck ["The power of believing that you can improve-TEDxNorrkoping"](https://www.ted.com/talks/carol_dweck_the_power_of_believing_that_you_can_improve?language=en) (accessed by Benjamin Hobbs on 7/9/2023)

  * Run from difficulty (don't engage with it)

Key Questions:
* Are we raising kids for 'now' instead of 'yet'?

Key Takeaways:

## Grit
From Angela Lee Duckworth ["Grit: The power of passion and perseverance"-TED Talks Education](https://www.ted.com/talks/angela_lee_duckworth_grit_the_power_of_passion_and_perseverance/c) (accessed by Benjamin Hobbs on 7/9/2023)

Key Ideas:
* Understanding students from a motivational perspective
* Grit is a common denominator of success- not social intelligence, good looks, IQ, or good health.
* Grit is passion and perserverance for long-term goals. Stamina. Living life as a marathon, not a sprint
* Science knows little about building Grit
  * Talent does not make you gritty. 
* GROWTH MINDSET is connected to Grit

Key Takeaways:
* We need to be gritty about getting our kids grittier
