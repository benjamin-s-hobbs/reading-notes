## What is Malware Analysis?

### The Six-Step Analysis Process
   1. Capture the malware - 
   2. Build a malware lab - 
   3. Install your tools -
   4. Record the baseline -
   5. Commence the investigation -
   6. Document the results -

## Types of Malware Analysis

* 4 Types: 
  
    * Static -

    * Dynamic -

    * Manual -

    * Automated - 

## Key Stages of Malware Analysis

* Observing malware behavior

* Disassembling the code

* Examining the memory


# Top 6 Best Practices for Malware Analysis (2021)

### 1. Expand your malware sample size continuously
### 2. Use automation to optimize your efforts
### 3. Always use a secure environment to run malware
### 4. Only analyze malware whose remote infrastructure is running
### 5. Capture and store VM image snapshots
### 6. Do your research and select the best-fit malware analysis tools


## Questions For Understanding

1. You just started a new job as a Malware Analyst. Explain your job responsibilities to a family member.
   * I take the things that bad people use to twist and break people's computer's and I examine them to find a way to fix the computer, and to stop it from happening to other computers. 
   * If I did this for people, I might be thought of as a doctor of some sort.
2. What are the six steps of the Malware Analysis process? Whatâ€™s a good mnemonic you can use to remember it?
   1. Capture the malware
   2. Build a malware lab
   3. Install your tools
   4. Record the baseline
   5. Commence the investigation
   6. Document the results

   * A mnemonic that may assist with learning this is: To **CAPTURE** the flag, **BUILD** a fortress, then **INSTALL** your defenses. **RECORD** the battlefiefield as it is, **COMMENCE** the fight...when you prevail, they will sing songs that **DOCUMENT** your victory for thousands of years.
     
3. You are tasked with analyzing a new malware sample. Which type of malware analysis would you conduct first and why? 
   * Out of the four types of malware analysis (static, dynamic, manual, automated) I would choose a static anaylsis of a manual nature. A static review may show what the malicious nature of the malware is (and therefore wouldn't warrant further research). If further examination would be necessary and we still aren't sure about the malware's capabilities, breaking it down manually would help to learn more about it safely.
