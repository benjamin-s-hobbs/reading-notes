## What is Penetration Testing?

 * A penetration test ("pen test" for short) is a simulated cyber attack against a computer system or network to determine exloitable vulnerabilities.
   * Pen testing can involve the attempted breaching of any number of application systems (APIs, frontend/backend servers, components, etc.)

   ### Stages of a pen test

   1. Planning and Reconnaissance
      * Test goals are defined and intelligence is gathered
         * Identify what the scope of the test is, including systems in play, testing methods allowed, knowledge possessed upfront, etc.
         * Conduct recon to assess systems and identify vulns

   2. Scanning
      * 

   3. Gaining Access (Initial Entry)
      * 
 
   4. Maintaining Access (Persistence)
      * 

   5. Analysis and Results ()
      * 



## Questions for further understanding
1. How are the stages of a pen test very similar to those of the Cyber Kill Chain?
  * 
2. Your manager has asked you to explain the benefits of a pentest to the companyâ€™s leadership. How would you lead this conversation?
