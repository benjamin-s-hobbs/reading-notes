## What is SOC 2 compliance?

* SOC 2 is a framework applying to businesses storing computer data in the cloud.
* SOC 2 Certification (on its own) is generally not enough to prove 100% security as an organization, but it is a good start.
* SOC stands for Service Organizations Control Report No. 2

### History

Prior to SOC 2, the standard for auditing service organizations was a Statement of Auditing Standards No. 70 (SAS 70.) SAS 70 audits were:
  * performed by Certified Public Accountants (CPAs)
     * original intent was to report on the effectiveness of internal financial controls. 
     * introduced in the early 1990's.
     * Over time, it became a way to report on the effectiveness of a company's internal controls around information security more broadly.
Around 2010, SOC 1 and SOC 2 reports were introduced by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) 
  * created to explicitly address the growing need for companies to externally validate and communicate their state of security.
    * SOC 1 reports are centered are controls impacting financial reports, similar to the original SAS 70.
    * SOC 2 reports are written against the Trust Services Criteria (TSC) standard, which is ideal to improve a company's maturity around business processes and security.

## SOC 2 "Trust Principles"

SOC audits are organized around five "Trust Principles." When audited, a company chooses which principles they want the auditor to attest to- a business decision driven by what is important to the company's clientle. The five Trust Principles are:
  * **Security** - The foundational security principle, common to all audits. 
  * **Confidentiality** - Protection from unauthorized disclosure of data.
  * **Availability** - Protection that systems or data will be available as agreed or required. 
  * **Integrity** - Protection that systems or data are not changed in an unauthorized manner.
  * **Privacy** - The use, collection, retentin, disclosure, and disposal of personal information is protected.


## SOC 2 Audits

### SOC 2 "Common Criteria"

All SOC 2 audits include "Common Criteria." This is the largest section of the audit and touches on every aspect of information security controls. Companies might start with a Common Criteria audit if they are looking to keep the scope small. 
* More mature Software as a Service (SaaS) companies tend to add on **Confidentiality** and **Availability**.
* Companies processing a lot of transactions (like financial institutions) typically choose **Integrity**
* Note: **Privacy** is seldom included as part of a SOC 2 audit as most organizations tend to focus their privacy compliance efforts with a separate, often more stringent, standard (such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act ([HIPAA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_Insurance_Portability_and_Accountability_Act)) in the U.S. or the General Data Protection Regulation ([GDPR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation)) in the EU.)

The Common Criteria Topics are:
* Organization & Management
* Communications
* Risk Management
* Monitoring of Controls
* Logical and Physical Access Controls
* System Operations
* Change Management

### SOC 2 Audit Process

The SOC 2 reporting standard is defined by the AICPA. All SOC 2 audits are signed by licensed CPAs. Companies typically prepare anywhere from six months to a year for a SOC 2 audit. 

* Prep
  * Identifying which systems will be in scope for the audit.
  * Developing policies and procedures in compliance with the standard.
    * Create new official documentation.
  * Implementing new security controls (if necessary) to reduce risk. 
    * Update internal processes.
    * Conduct employee training and education on new policies and procedures.
* Audit 
  * The Organization will hire a licensed CPA auditor to conduct the audit.
  * CPA conducts the actual process, which consists of (to include):
    * Scoping (determining the scope of the audit)
      * What type of audit is this? SOC 1? SOC 2? Type I? Type II?
      * SOC 1 - Financial Scope
      * SOC 2 - Information Security Scope
      * Type I audit - At a single point in time
      * Type II audit - Over a period of time (usually six months or a year)
      * e.g. A SOC 2 Type II audit would be for an Information Security Scope over a period of time. 
    * Document request and collection (Requests usually made via phone or email)
    * Conduct an On-Site Visit (typically 2 days)
      * Interviews
      * Review submitted materials
