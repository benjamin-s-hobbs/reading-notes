## What is Data Loss Prevention (DLP)?

* Data Loss Prevention is a set of tools and processes used to ensure that sensitive data is not lost, misused, or accessed by unauthorized users.

## 3 Main Use Cases for DLP

1. Personal Information Protection/Compliance
   * If your organization collects Personal Identifiable Information (PII), Protected Health Information (PHI), or Payment Card Information (PCI) then it may be subject to comply with tighter regulations 
     * Health Insurance Portability and Affordability Act (HIPAA) [for PHI]
     * General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) [for PII of EU residents]
2. IP Protection
3. Data Visibility

* Honorable mention for use cases also goes to: 
  * insider threats
  * user and entity behavior analysis
  * suspected advanced persistent threats (APTs)

## Trends driving the adoption of DLP

1. Growth of the CISO role:
2. Evolving Compliance Mandates:
3. More Places to Protect Your Data:
4. Data Breaches are Frequent and Large:
5. Your Organization's Stolen Data is Worth More:
6. There's More Data to Steal:
7. There's a Security Talent Shortage:

## Other considerations about DLP

* Determine your primary data protection objective first
  * What is the most appropriate DLP deployment architecture or combination of architecture for your organization?
    * There are four main DLP architectures:
    * Endpoint DLP
    * Network DLP
    * Discovery
    * Cloud
* DLP is a business decision, not a security-only decision
  * you need buy in from senior leadership (CFO, CEO, etc.)
* When researching vendors - establish evaluation criteria ahead of time. Such as: 
    * What types of deployment architectures are offered?
    * Do they support Windows, Linux, and OS X with feature parity?
    * What deployment options do they offer? Do they provide managed services?
    * Do you need to defend against mainly internal or external threats? Or both?
    * Do you need to perform content- or context-based inspection and classification? Will your users be able to self-classify documents? Do you need a blend of multiple methods?
    * Are you most concerned with protecting structured or unstructured data?
    * Do you plan to see and enforce data movement based on policies, events, or users?
    * What compliance regulations are you bound by? What new regulations are on the horizon?
    * Who are their technology alliance partners and what technologies would you like to integrate with your DLP?
    * How quickly do you need to deploy your DLP program?
    * Will you need additional staff to manage your DLP program?
* Document, document, document
* Share reporting with stakeholders and business leaders.
* ***DLP is a program, not a product.***
