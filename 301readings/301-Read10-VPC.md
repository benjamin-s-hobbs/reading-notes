(A Private Cloud hosted in a public cloud)

* A Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) is a secure, isolated private cloud hosted within a public cloud. One can run code, store data, host websites, and do anything else they could do in an ordinary private cloud, but the private cloud is hosted remotely by a public cloud provider. VPCs combine the scalability and convenience of public cloud computing with the data isolation of private cloud computing.
