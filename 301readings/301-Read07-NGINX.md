# NGINX
From https://www.nginx.com/resources/glossary/nginx/

* NGINX is open source software for web serving, reverse proxying, caching, load balancing, media streaming, and more. 

    * Can also function as a proxy server for email (POP3, IMAP, and SMTP)

    * Can also function as a reverse proxy and load balancer for HTTP, TCP and UDP servers.

## History

* Created by Igor Sysoev to solve the C10K problem (term coined in 1999 describing the difficulty that existing web servers experienced in handling large numbers of concurrent connections)

* NGINX was revolutionary for server operation (in high-performance contexts) and was the fastest web server available momentarily 

* Sysoev open-sourced the project in 2004 and its use grew. Sysoev co-founded NGINX, Inc to support continued development and to market a commercial product in NGINX Plus with additional features. Today NGINX, Inc is part of F5 Inc. and is still widely used.
