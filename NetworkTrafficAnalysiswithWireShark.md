# Layers Of The OSI Model

From https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/layers-of-osi-model/

## What is the OSI Model?

* The Open Systems Interconnection Model (OSI Model) was developed by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) in 1984.

* There are seven layers to this model.

   1. Physical Layer - actual physical connection between devices (wires, connectors, etc)

   2. Data Link Layer - data transfer from node to node

   3. Network Layer - 

   4. Transport Layer - 

   5. Session Layer - 

   6. Presentation Layer - 

   7. Application Layer - 

* Data has pieces added on to it as it goes from Layer 7 to Layer 1 in a process called encapsulation and pieces taken off it as it goes from Layer 1 to Layer 7 in a process called deencapsulation

## Physical Layer 

* Information is transmitted in binary in bits

* Wires, Connectors, Hubs, etc are what this Layer consist of

  * Topologies (bus, star, mesh, ring)

  * Transmission modes (simplex, half-duplex, full-duplex)

* A Layer 1 issue refers to a faulty connection, or crosstalk or interference on wires, or something of this nature.
