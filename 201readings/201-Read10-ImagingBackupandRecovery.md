## Have you heard of Veeam?! What is Veeam!

Veeam is a tool (that costs $0.00) for backing up Virtual Machines (VMs) and Hyper-V environments. Currently on version 7 (v7), an update that delivers some important new features and capabilities. Here are 12 powerful features offered by Veeam Backup Free Edition:

1. VeeamZIP Backup - Creates an ad-hoc backup of a running VM, which gives you many benefits such as being able to easily copy a backup to another host without having to power off the original VM

2. Veeam Explorer for Exchange -

3. Veeam Explorer for Storage Snapshots -

4. Veeam Explorer for Sharepoint -

5. Quick Migration for VMware - Migrates a live VM between hosts or datastores with minimal downtime and without requiring clusters, shared storage, or even VMware vMotion or Storage vMotion

6. File Copy Job 

7. VM Copy Job 

8. FastSCP Editor 

9. Native tape support - Datacenters still actively use tapes for backup because they remain portable, somewhat durable, and inexpensive to maintain. 

10. File level recovery from backup 

11. Whole VM recovery from backup 

12. VM file recovery from backup (VMX, VHD, VMDK, etc.)

## Additional Features in v7
