# **Powershell: OS Upgrade and Remote Access**

## **Should You Learn Powershell?**

-What is Powershell?

**Powershell is a command-line interface ffom Microsoft to allow sysadmins and power users to manage computers from the command line. It is also a scripting language, built on .NET used to automate admin tasks and config mgmt. Tasks are performed by using cmdlets ("command-lettes") to execute a myriad of actions.**

Unlike other popular compiled languages today...Java, Javascript, Python, C#, and Ruby for example, which _**create **_something, Powershell is an interpreted language that _**does **_something 

Powershell is usually leveraged by people with job titles like: 

 - Systems Administrator

 - Network Administrator

 - Systems Engineer 

 - Site Reliability Engineer

 - Systems Development Engineer 

 - Cloud Architect 

 - Systems Architect

Different Shell Use has usually occurred due to preference of operating system (OS). For Example:

 - Linux >>>> Bash >>>> Python

 - Windows >>>> Powershell >>>> C#

However, now the Bash is available on Windows, and Powershell is available on Linux, the lines are beginning to blur a bit. Let's see what other differences these two have.
