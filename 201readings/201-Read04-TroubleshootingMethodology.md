## Identify The Problem

You need to understand what the problem might be
* Understanding is necessary to provide possible solutions (what could have caused the issue?)
* Can you duplicate the issue? this is a best practice.

     -Ask a lot of questions. (Is the issue localized or widespread? Question more users to find out.)

     -Break problems into smaller pieces to make them easier to handle.

Gather as much information as you can 

## Establish A Theory
 1. Occam's Razor - "The simplest answer is usually the correct one"

 2. However, consider all possible issues (make a list)

## Test The Theory

Begin testing theories

## Evaluate The Results: Is It Working?

## Establish A Plan of Action

* Make a Plan to Implement your fix (always consider your stakeholders)

* Have a Plan B (consider your stakeholders)

* Consider a third plan, just in case...even if it's just to roll your changes back

* Does your plan have the proper green lights and approvals?
 
## Implement The Plan

## Verify Full System Functionality

## Document Findings

  1. Make sure to document your findings and your fix so you don't need to re-invent the wheel for next time. 

  2. Make sure people know where to find your documentation.
