## [HDI: So You Want To Write An SOP](https://www.thinkhdi.com/library/supportworld/2017/you-want-to-write-an-sop.aspx)

**A standard operating procedure (SOP) is a procedure specific to your company or organization that describes the activities necessary to complete a particular task. **

-The article's author feels that writing SOPs is both science and art. While I'd agree, the proof is always in the pudding. _**Rule #1 is an SOP MUST BE EFFECTIVE.**_ Otherwise, it is trash. Here are some other observational truths about SOPs:

 * They are not completely standalone. SOPs must be informed by policy (from above its level), and contribute to Work Instructions (to below its level).

     - Policy answers the "Why", and Work Instructions more specifically get to the "How." SOP is the in-between "some-why"/"What"/"When"/and "some-how"

 * SOPs encourage consistency in execution, which is important in a team environment.

 * SOPs must be kept current. SOPs that aren't current, aren't effective (See Rule #1).

## Things to consider

-SOPs must be:

* Readable - legible font sizes, numbered pages, titles, numbered paragraph headings, and effective use of whitespace

* Consumable - Using a template or predefined format so its easier to read. 

* Understandable - Focused and to the point. simple terms

* Actionable - Clearly describe what is to be done.

* Measurable - All described activities should be specific and measurable.
