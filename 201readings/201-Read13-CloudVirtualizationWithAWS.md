# Cloud Virtualization with AWS

* Relevance - The Cloud (in general) is a really progressive technology that's being talked a lot about lately. In practice, it's really just the ability to store and host- well almost everything- online. An InfoSec professional that I think of as a mentor, [Marsha Wilson](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marshajwilson/)-CEO of [ScaleSec](https://scalesec.com/) actually specializes in providing Cloud Security Solutions and in discussions with her I learned that it's possible that in the future, cloud services will be available and provided more like utilities. In order to get to that level, so much more has to happen: Laws, policies, more competition [Aside from Google/Amazon/Microsoft], and-of course security (looking at YOU, CISA.) Keep your eye on Cloud. From Cloud to Edge Computing- it's getting closer and closer to the end users.
